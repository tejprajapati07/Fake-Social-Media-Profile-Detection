# Fake Social Media Profile Detection

## Project Overview

**Fake Social Media Profile Detection** is a machine learning project designed to identify and detect fake social media profiles. Leveraging Django for the web application framework and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training neural networks, this project aims to provide a robust solution for distinguishing genuine profiles from fake ones.

## Features

- **Profile Analysis**: Evaluate profiles based on various features to detect fake profiles.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a neural network model for classification.
- **Django Web Interface**: User-friendly web interface for interacting with the detection system.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle varying loads and integrate with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for building the application.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the project.
- **TensorFlow**: Open-source library for machine learning and neural network construction.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for preprocessing and evaluating models.
- **Neural Networks**: For classification and detection tasks.
